- When the doctor suggested surgery
- and a brace for all my youngest years,
- my parents scrambled to take me
- to massage therapy, deep tissue work,
- osteopathy, and soon my crooked spin[^fn1] 
- unspooled a bit, I could breathe again,
- and move more in a body unclouded
- by pain. My mom would tell me to sing
- songs to her the whole forty-five-minute
- drive to Middle Two Rock Road and forty-
- five minutes back from physical therapy.
- She’d say that even my voice sounded unfettered
- by my spine afterward. So I sang and sang,
- because I thought she liked it. I never
- asked her what she gave up to drive me,
- or how her day was before this chore. Today,
- at her age, I was driving myself home from yet
- another spine appointment, singing along
- to some maudlin but solid song on the radio,
- and I saw a mom take her raincoat off
- and give it to her young daughter when
- a storm took over the afternoon. My god,
- I thought, my whole life I’ve been under her
- raincoat thinking it was somehow a marvel
- that I never got wet.

## Footnotes

[^fn1]:

	The author had just landed in La Guardia Airport after the flight captain died. All the passengers stood up to applaud the co-pilot. We have it in good authority that the event in question led Yoko Ono to write her "Letter to John":

	> - On a windy day let's go flying
	> - There may be no trees to rest on
	> - There may be no clouds to ride
	> - But we'll have our wings and the wind will be with us
	> - That's enough for me, that's enough for me.
